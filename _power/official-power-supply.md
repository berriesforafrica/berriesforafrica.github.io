## Evaluation

This power supply is the recommended power supply to use. It produces 5.1V instead of the 5V produced by most USB-C power supplies for mobile phones. This makes it more compatible with the power needs of the Raspberry Pi which can be important when additional peripheral devices are connected to it.

It also produces 3A which is important when you are overclocking the CPU or when you are connecting a  touch screen.
