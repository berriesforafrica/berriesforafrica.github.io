## Evaluation

Excellent HDMI to VGA adapter.

Supports resolutions up to 1920x1080 @ 60Hz.

Power is drawn from the HDMI connection and so no additional power source is required. 

**Note:** Because VGA has no support for audio, you need to connect an audio device to play sounds.

**Note:** Because VGA has no support for copy protection, you can not use this connection to play protected content (eg Netflix videos).
