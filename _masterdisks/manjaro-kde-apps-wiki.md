## Create a Manajaro KDE Apps Masterdisk

Follow the procedure in [Masterdisk: Manjaro KDE Apps](/masterdisks/manjaro-kde-apps/) to create a masterdisk with the Manjaro KDE Operating System and a full suite of KDE apps.

**Note:** As the full Wikipedia content is 95 GB in size, you will need an SSD of at least 240 GB.

### Offline Wikipedia Setup

Follow the procedure in [Installing Offline Wikipedia](/manjaro-kde/installing-offline-wikipedia/) to add offline Wikipedia browsing.

The following additional apps will be available:

```
Education
└── Miscellaneous
    ├── Start Wikipedia
    └── Browse Wikipedia
```

If all Wikipedia content is installed, about 54% of the available space (219.8 GB) is now occupied leaving about 100.3 GB of the total disk space free.
