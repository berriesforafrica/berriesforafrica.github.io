Computers are becoming more powerful, cheaper and smaller.

To the point that even the smallest and cheapest devices now surpass the capabilities of most 5 year old computers.

Making them extremely useful for creating a computer infrastructure that satifies the needs of many people, small businesses and educational institutions. 

One of such small and cheap devices is the Raspberry Pi. Created to serve the needs of a growing community of DIY electronics enthousiasts, the Raspberry Pi has now evolved to such a point that - when applied in a suitable way - it can be a powerful building block in the creation of a suitable computer infastructure for users, companies or institutions. 

Being widely available at low cost, small and easily transportable and replaceable, the Raspberry Pi is an excellent platform for satisfying the computational needs of users, businesses and organisations that do not want to spend the majority of their budget on computers. Making them also very usefull in developing countries. 

And being a platform with low power requirements and requiring less material resources because of its small size, the Raspberry Pi is also a perfect platform for creating a computer infrastructure in an environment-friendly way.

That is why we created the **Berries For Power** project. The main mission of this project is to document and promote the use of Raspberry Pi's to create computer infrastructure that contribute to development and that are environment-friendly. And to serve as a community platform for accumulating and sharing knowledge. 


### What is a Raspberry Pi?

TODO - Overview

### Why Raspberry Pi's

TODO - summary of advantages

### Key factors to consider for a performant setup

- explain the need for USB boot from SSD
- supported by current low costs for storage


### Separating Storage from Computing (ALT: Storage-centric Computing)

Taking profit of a setup using SSD drives that are connected externally to the main computer board, we also want to take another step forward in making the Raspberry Pi an efficient platform for developing countries and educational institutions. And that is to consider the storage as not being an integrated part of the computer, but to consider it as a separate component at the system level.

This allows us to define a computer system not as the integration of a compute unit (the CPU) with one fixed storage unit, but as a dynamic combination of a compute unit with several interchangeable storage units.

The possibilities of this approach are mind-blowing. 

Instead of creating a fixed setup of one computing unit with one Operating System containing a fixed set of Applications, we can now create one computing unit with a collection of Operating Systen / Applications combinations.

For example, applied to schools, this can allow the teaching staff to create storage units for different educational needs. For example a disk for the mathematics class only containing mathematics applications. Or a Wikipedia disk that can be used in libraries and that only brings up one single application that allows offline browsing of all Wikipedia content. Or a games disk, to be used during breaks, that enables the same compute unit to be used for entertainment purposes but in a controlled way. 

The possibilities are really endless. 

### Redefining Personal Computing 
 
- = creating storage units for a personal setup
- allows for a shared computer infrastructure, where one computing unit is used by several people

Again, the possibilities are endless. For example, in a school content, instead of taking along an expensive and bulky laptop, students can bring alone a small storage unit that they plug into a computer available in school or at home.

### Easing installations by cloning storage units

- by creating a collection of suitable storage units, the process of installation is reduced to a simple disk clonging process
- supported by SSD disk cloning devices

### Modular setups

- A computer is defined as a modular combination of a compute unit, a storage unit, a display, a sound unit, a power unitm, a keyboard and a mouse. 
- Many advantages from defining a computer system as a modular combination of separate units:
  - Support. Only replace part that is broken.
  - Transport
