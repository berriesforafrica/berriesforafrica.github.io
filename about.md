Computers are becoming more powerful, cheaper and smaller.

To the point that even the smallest and cheapest devices now surpass the capabilities of most 5 year old computers.

Making them extremely useful for creating a computer infrastructure that satifies the needs of many small businesses and educational institutions. 

One of such small and cheap devices is the Raspberry Pi. Created to serve the needs of a growing community of DIY electronics enthousiasts, the Raspberry Pi has now evolved to such a point that - when applied in a suitable way - it can be a powerful cornerstone in the computer infastructure of many companies or institutions. 

Being widely available at low cost, small and easily transportable and resplaceable, we are convinced that the Raspberry Pi is an excellent platform for satisfying the computational needs of business and organisations that do not want to spend the majority of their budget on computers. Making them especially usefull in developing countries. 

And being a platform with low power requirements and requiring less material resources because of its small size, the Raspberry Pi is also a perfect platform for creating a computer infrastructure in an environment-friendly way.

That is why we created the **Power Berries** project. The main mission of this project is to promote our approach to building Raspberry Pi-based conmputer infrastructures in a development-promotional and environment-friendly way. And to serve as a community platform for accumulating and sharing knowledge. 


### What is a Raspberry Pi?


### Why Raspberry Pi's

There are many advantages of using Raspberry Pi's as desktop computers in developing countries.

- They are small. Which means: easy to transport, less prone to fall damage
- They are cheap. 
- They are ARM-based. ARM processors are leading computers into the next decade

### Key factors to consider for a performant setup

- explain the need for USB boot from SSD
- supported by current low costs for storage


### Separating Storage from Computing (ALT: Storage-centric Computing)

Taking profit of a setup using SSD drives that are connected externally to the main computer board, we also want to take another step forward in making the Raspberry Pi an efficient platform for developing countries and educational institutions. And that is to consider the storage as not being an integrated part of the computer, but to consider is as a separate component at the system level.

This allows us to define a computer system not as the integration of a compute component (the CPU) with one fixed storage component, but as a dynamic combination of a compute component with several interchangeable storage components.

The possibilities of this approach are mind-blowing. 

Instead of creating a fixed setup of one computing unit with one Operating System containing a fixed set of Applications, we can now create one computing unit with a collection of Operating Systen / Applications combinations.

For example, applied to schools, this can allow the teaching staff to create storage units for different educational needs. For example a disk for the mathematics class only containing mathematics applications. Or a Wikipedia disk that can be used in libraries and that only brings up one single application that allows offline browsing of all Wikipedia content. Or a games disk, to be used during breaks, that enables the same compute unit to be used for entertainment purposes but in a controlled way. 

The possibilities are real endless.
