## Evaluation
This disk is not as performant as an SSD, but sits somewhere in the middle between micro SD and SSD.  
It has about 6 times the write performance of a micro SD card and about the same read performance. 

See [the Storage Benchmarks article]({{ "" | relative_url }}../storage-benchmarks/) for a more detailed review of the performance of this disk.

This disk is recommended when a lot of performance is required from a very small form factor.
