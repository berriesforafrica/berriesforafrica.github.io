## Evaluation

This speaker has a nice sucker mount to put it on the Raspberry Pi case. Unfortunately, we were not able to make it work. 

| On Raspberry Pi OS Buster arm64 2020-05-27 | Not OK. Pairs but delivers a distorted sound |
| On Manjaro KDE 20.08 | Not OK. Pairs but delivers a distorted sound. |
