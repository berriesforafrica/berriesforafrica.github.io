## Evaluation

Features:<br>
- Magnetic cover that still gives access to the GPIO pins for future expansions.
- Is delivered with a nice bag and a screw driver for mounting.
- Both passive (the aluminium case acts as a heatsink) and active (built-in fan) cooling.
- All connections are moved to the back of the case.
- On/Off switch at the back of the case.

On the negative side:
- No built-in support for a camera.
- To make the on/off switch work, drivers need to be installed. Unfortunately, these drivers are not yet fully supported on the Manjaro Linux distribution. 
- In general, we  disadvise against the use of fans as they are moving parts that can easily collect dust and get broken. 
- Putting this case together is a bit more elaborate than with the Argon Neo case.
