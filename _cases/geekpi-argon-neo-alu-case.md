## Evaluation

Excellent, recommended case. 
- Magnetic cover that still gives access to the GPIO pins for future expansions.
- Is delivered with a nice bag and a screw driver for mounting.
- Can support a camera.
- Excellent passive cooling properties thanks to the aluminium case acting as a heatsink.
- No drivers to install.

The case can also be equipped with a fan that fits on the GPIO pins (a header fan board). However, in general, we  disadvise against the use of fans as they are moving parts that can easily collect dust and get broken.
