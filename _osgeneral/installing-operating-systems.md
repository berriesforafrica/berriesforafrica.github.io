excerpt: "General Procedure to install an Operating System on an SSD disk"

To install an Operating System on an SSD, you need to follow this general procedure:

1. Install the Raspberry Pi Imager tool.

	This tool is by default installed in Raspberry Pi OS.<br>
	It is also available for other Linux distributions, Windows and Mac. 
	
	NOTE. Unfortunately, the Raspberry Pi Imager tool is not available for the Manjaro Linux distribution. So if you want to install an OS on an SSD using the Raspberry Pi, you have to use the Raspberry Pi OS.
	{: .notice--warning}
2. Download the required OS image
3. Uncompress the required OS image
4. Start the Raspberry Pi Imager tool and use it to write the required OS to the SSD. You can follow the same procedure as for the installation of OS images on SD cards as explained [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/ "Installing Operating System images"). Just replace the words “SD card” with “SSD disk”.
